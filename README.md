## Summary
This is a travel blog website which provides a short overview of the site owner's top 10 destinations in Europe. 

The site includes a Google Map with markers showing recommended places to visit, eat and stay. 

There is also a feedback section where site users can make recommendations for destinations for the site owner to visit next. They can also recommend places to visit, stay and eat in the destinations already on the site. In addition the form the site user submits will ask for permission for the site owner to contact them for further information and whether they can be credited in the recommendation when it is published on the website.
# UX
<!-- Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser. -->


Site user's goals:
The users are potential and existing fans who wish to know more about the band.

As a site user, I want to view images of the band to compliment the audio files
As a site user, I want to hear music from the band, so that I can hear new and existing tracks
As a site user, I want to be able to view a list of tour dates and venues, so that I can see when the band have a gig I am able to attend
As a site user, I want to be able to view the bio of the band members, so that I can learn more about them
As a site user, I want to have links to the band's social media pages, so that it is easy to find
Site owner's goals:
As a site owner, I want the website to increase the band's profile
As a site owner, I want band member information to be accessible for fans, to increase the individual band member's profiles
As a site owner, I want to increase the band's fan base and to keep existing fans engaged, so that users return on a regular basis
As a site owner, I want tour dates to be visible, to increase attendance at gigs

# Bugs

 # Technologies Used
 <!-- In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation. -->

- Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/
- JavaScript
- Emailjs
- Google Maps
- Google fonts - https://fonts.google.com/

# Testing
<!-- In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->

# Deployment
<!-- This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally. -->
