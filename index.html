        <p>A famous French song says "I love Paris in May when suddenly everything comes to life, happy to see the sun
            shining".
        <br><br>Paris is sublime in the spring but it is worth a visit at any time of the year. Culturally unrivaled, Paris
            is the destination to put on top of your travel bucket list if you like cultural city breaks. The museums of
            Paris house the greatest masterpieces but its streets, alleys, artist workshops are all to be enjoyed!
            Picasso, Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp, Brancusi, Yves Klein, Modigliani, but also Moli√®re, Zola, Hugo lived in
            ‚Äúthe most beautiful city in the world. 
        <br><br>Paris combines Rome and Berlin‚Äôs treasures in one. The city is very lively, both historic and very modern and
            art is simply everywhere! For centuries Paris has been setting the tone for the whole country, Europe and
            the world. Paris is everything: gastronomy, romance, elegance, madness, beauty‚Ä¶ Paris is a city of human
            experiences: walk and get lost in its beautiful alleys and parks in the Luxembourg Gardens or the Parc des
            Buttes-Chaumont.
        <br><br>Treat yourself to a delicious ice cream on Ile Saint-Louis, be dazzled by Klein‚Äôs blue colour at the Pompidou
            Museum, take a walk in the Marais district or find a rare object at the Saint-Ouen Flea market.</p>
